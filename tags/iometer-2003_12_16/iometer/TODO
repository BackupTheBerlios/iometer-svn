ToDo:
=====

 - IOManager.cpp: As a code remark says, GHz SPARC CPU's has to be recognised
   in the Login() method (processor_speed_to_nsecs variable).
 - IOMessage.h / IOTest.h: Merge the files into a common one.
 - IOPerformance.cpp / IOPerformanceLinux.cpp: Consolidate the Get_*_Counters()
   and Extract_*_Counters() methods for all operating systems (only one name
   schema).
 - <All>: Check if it is possible to move the reorder() function calls into the
   Send() / Receive() methods (eases code and makes it more solid).
 - <All>: Move all Includes out of the codefiles into the central headerfile
   (IOCommon.h).
 - <All>: Move all Defines out of the codefiles into the central headerfile
   and/or its Makefiles.
 - <All>: Include "IOCommon.h" into all files.
 - <All>: Decouple the code in that way, that it is possible to seperate
   the files into a common, dynamo and iometer subdirectory.
 - <Docu>: Finding the documentation "sources" which was used to generate the
   Iometer User's Guide (PDF from October 20, 1999).
 - <Docu>: Diagram showing the message flow between Iometer and Dynamo as well
   as a analyses of the exchanged data structures.
