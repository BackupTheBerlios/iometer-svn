* Decide which kernel you are using. 2.4.x or 2.6.x, then
	cp Makefile-Linux2x Makefile (x = 4 or 6)
Note: make sure to do this for 2.6.x kernel. a "make -f Makefile-26" doesnot work

* Build kernel module (use root if compile for 2.6.x)
	make
* Load kernel module as root
	./load
* Build user space test program
	make -f Makefile-user
* Run test program
	./test
* run "dmesg" to check if reported data are same.
* Unload kernel module
	./unload

Notes:
Currently it only support IA32, I will try to add ARM support later.
