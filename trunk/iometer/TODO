ToDo:
=====

 - IOCommon.h: Ensure, that there is only one "Operation System", "Operating
   System Platform" ,"Endian Type" and "Processor Type" define while make.
 - IOManager.cpp: As a code remark says, GHz SPARC CPU's has to be recognised
   in the Login() method (processor_speed_to_nsecs variable).
 - IOMessage.h / IOTest.h: Merge the files into a common one.
 - IOPerformance.cpp / IOPerformanceLinux.cpp: Consolidate the Get_*_Counters()
   and Extract_*_Counters() methods for all operating systems (only one name
   schema).
 - IOPerformanceLinux.cpp: Cut out all the _WIN32 and _WIN64 related methods
   (like Extract_CPU_Counters, Calculate_Stat,...).
 - IOTime.h / IOTime.cpp: Merge the files into a common one.
 - IOVersion.h: Drop all the unneeded defines like IOVER_FILE and IOVER_PRODUCT
 - <All>: Check if it is possible to move the reorder() function calls into the
   Send() / Receive() methods (eases code and makes it more solid).
 - <All>: Move all Includes out of the codefiles into the central headerfile
   (IOCommon.h).
 - <All>: Move all Defines out of the codefiles into the central headerfile
   and/or its Makefiles.
 - <All>: Define seperate global defines for
    - Operating System:
      LINUX, SOLARIS, WINDOWS
    - Operating System Platform (can be set based on Operating System):
      WINTEL (Windows, OS/2), UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris,...)
    - Processor:
      IA32, IA64, SPARC
 - <All>: Endian Type could be detected during runtime. This can be done with a
   new Performance::Get_Endian_Type() method.
 - <All>: Decouple the code in that way, that it is possible to seperate
   the files into a common, dynamo and iometer subdirectory.
 - <Docu>: Finding the documentation "sources" which was used to generate the
   Iometer User's Guide (PDF from October 20, 1999).
 - <Docu>: Diagram showing the message flow between Iometer and Dynamo as well
   as a analyses of the exchanged data structures.

Wishlist:
=========

 - IOMeter: Command-line version.
 - <All>: uDAFS support.
 - <All>: Object-Based Storage Devices support.
 - ...
