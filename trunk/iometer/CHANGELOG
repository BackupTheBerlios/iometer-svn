ChangeLog (2003.nn.nn):
=======================


- Applied patches:
  - iometer-2003.02.15-HandleDummy0.patch by Daniel Scheibli (modifies
    the Get_NI_Counter function to handle interfaces without leading
    blanks (like dummy0) as well).
  - iometer-2003.02.15-NoPipe.patch by Daniel Scheibli (removes the 
    Windows Pipes support for communication which simplifies the code).
  - iometer-2003.02.15_Get_NI_Counter.patch by Joe Eiler (brings the
    handling for network interfaces that does not contain statistics
    in /proc/net/dev - as for example with Intel Link Aggreation).    
  - iometer-2003.02.15_Exclude_Filesys.patch by Joe Eiler (additional
    command line parameter for Dynamo to pass into file systems which
    should be hidden).
  - iometer-2003.02.15_Extra_Processor_Info.patch by Joe Eiler (brings
    new processor speed values as well as improvements for the GHz CPU
    detection).
- Cleanup:
   - Changed LINUX_DEBUG and NDEBUG to _DEBUG which is the generic
     define used for this effort.
   - Dropped different unneeded defines in IOVersion.h
   - Dropped clean_ctlm.c, because we can use the recode tool instead.
   - Merged rdtsc.c into IOTime.cpp
   - Cleaned up some compiler warnings on Solaris
   - Changes NO_LINUX_VI to NO_DYNAMO_VI so Solaris build can use it also
   - Dropped the IOCq.cpp file, because it was empty.
- Others:
   - Made some minor changes to get Iometer to compile with VC++ 7 (.NET)
     Note: No MSVC++ project files have been checked in, you will have to
     let VC++ convert the project for you.  This worked for fine for me.
   - Added the Wizard.mdb file from the old days (version 1999.10.20).
   - rewrote the Solaris Makefile to match the Linux stuff
   - Added the output of the major and minor number during the detection
     of the sector size (of physical disks).
   - Rewrite of the .../README file (containing additions for the Iometer
     User's Guide as well as text for a future Developers Guide).



ChangeLog (2003.02.15):
=======================

- Applied patches:
   - iometer.patch by Matt D. Robinson (ensures, that there is an allocated
     buffer for each worker thread - needed for large amounts of I/O through
     ServerWorks chipsets).
- Bugfixes:
   - Different changes to get Dynamo compiled with gcc 3.2 - in the past there
     was some problem known as cout << hex error (include <sstream> instead of
     include <strstream.h> etc).
   - Modified the sector size detection for physical disks under Linux in that
     way, that major and minor number are recognised (was the major number
     only).
   - Added CPU time in user mode with low priority (nice) to the user mode
     utilization as well as the total CPU utilization.
- Cleanup:
   - Dropped the IOMessage.cpp and IOTest.cpp file, because they are empty.
- Others:
   - Under Linux, NFS devices are now supported by default (in older versions
     they was excluded per default).



ChangeLog (2003.02.08):
=======================

- Applied patches:
   - iometer-initial-datatypes.patch
   - iometer-initial-largefile.patch (allows >2GB files under Linux)
   - proc-speed-fix.txt (addresses the 2 GHz CPU issue)
   - Created Iometer.dsw, Iometer.dsp and Dynamo.dsp by merging the files
     contributed earlier by Matt D. Robinson and Jeffery Bahr (allows to
     compile Iometer and Dynamo under Windows).
- Bugfixes:
   - Added support for the CPU utilization and Interrupts statistic on Linux
- Cleanup:
   - Different changes to Makefile-Linux
- New functionality:
   - Addition parameter for Dynamo (optional), to pass the network name Iometer
     should use to communicate with Dynamo. That way it is possible to run the
     communication over the second NIC for example.
- Others:
   - Added the .../src/res tree as well as the .../Docs tree as found in the
     CVS tree at Sourceforge.
   - Started a Todo list with issues needed to be addressed for the code
     cleanup. The file is named .../TODO.
   - Started a modest documentation of the source structure which can be found
     in .../README.
